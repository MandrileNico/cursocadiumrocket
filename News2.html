                    Fortnite creator Epic Games is partnering with carmakers, starting with General Motors, to use its Unreal 
                    Engine game development platform to build in-car software in what Epic is calling its 
                    “human-machine interface” (HMI) initiative. The first car to use Unreal Engine, which is 
                    the primary software toolset with which developers make Fortnite and countless other big-budget
                    video games, will be GMC’s upcoming Hummer EV, 
                    <a  class="linth2" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436401/gm-hummer-electric-reveal-date-picup-truck-crab-mode"> 
                        set to be unveiled on October 20th.
                    </a> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The logic is simple: modern cars are primarily designed using software, and assembled
                    cars carry scores of onboard computers and rely on touchscreens and digital interfaces to 
                    power infotainment centers and other sources of information displayed to drivers. And Unreal 
                    Engine is a great platform for building software, which Epic thinks makes it a great platform 
                    for building the software that goes into cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “When you sit in the driver’s seat of a modern car today, the way you interact with 
                    the vehicle is different from a few years ago. Buttons and screens dominate the 
                    dashboard, steering wheel, and instrument pane, providing features that may be new
                    to you. Electrification is at the root of many of these advances, with digital 
                    hardware such as cameras, sensors, and displays, combined with cutting-edge 
                    technology like Unreal Engine, forming a framework on which to build new 
                    experiences,” the company explains in a blog post. “At Epic Games, we’ve long been
                    interested in the way the requirements for HMI development overlap with those of 
                    game development. Much of the functionality required to create HMI systems has been
                    available in Unreal Engine for some time.”

                    Epic says carmakers like GMC and the user interface and user experience designers 
                    tasked with crafting the software that car owners will interact with in the finished 
                    product can do more and do it faster using tools like Unreal Engine. Epic says this 
                    should empower designers to have a more active role in the development of the software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “In traditional HMI workflows, UI/ UX designers produce ‘hero screens’ or reference 
                    images that outline how the UI is supposed to look. They rarely get to see their 
                    designs in action soon enough to iterate on them, because it’s up to engineers to 
                    implement the design and the functionality into the vehicle,” Epic explains. Unreal 
                    Engine is also a cross-platform game engine, which means designers could easily 
                    preview new builds in prototype vehicles on iOS or Android tablets without needing 
                    to duplicate efforts by rebuilding the software to work on mobile devices.

                    What will this actually mean for consumers using next-generation car software 
                    designed using Unreal Engine? Epic says it’s already enabling some pretty impressive 
                    advancements. For instance, infotainment screens built using the game engine can get up 
                    and running much faster, as Epic’s toolset allows developers to fire up various portions 
                    of the software in sequential order instead of all at once. “Content that is not needed 
                    at startup can be loaded after the initial boot, reducing boot time even further,” the 
                    company says.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because Unreal Engine is designed to enable photorealistic computer-generated 
                    graphics, car software can also display full, high-resolution renders of the vehicle 
                    as well as its various internal and underside parts and mechanical and software mechanisms, 
                    on central screens and other displays.

                    “Unreal Engine provides best-in-class visuals for production HMI, with car paint 
                    materials and reflections that bring the highest quality real-time graphics to 
                    the vehicle,” Epic says. “A comprehensive set of visual effects features that 
                    have been hardened by game development give automotive designers a robust set of 
                    tools to express creativity in their HMI designs.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Epic says its work on in-car software and partnership with General Motors is based 
                    on a prediction that autonomous vehicles will one day make the act of driving less 
                    important than the activities you can do in the car when software is driving it for 
                    you. Whether that’s streaming video, playing games, or using communication features 
                    for voice and video calls, Epic is interested in positioning the Unreal Engine as a 
                    core pillar of how all those features and functions get built.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What if an automotive brand had their own games that only their vehicle users can 
                    access? Or drivers could customize their HMI visuals and voice assistant with the 
                    personality of their favorite video game character?” the company writes. “With Unreal 
                    Engine as the HMI platform, opportunities such as this become possible.”
